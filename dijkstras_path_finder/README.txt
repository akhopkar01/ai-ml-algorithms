# Path planning using Dijkstra's Algorithm

#### The problem statement is to find the shortest path in terms of cost for a point and rigid robot to reach from one point to a target position in a 2-D map comprising of obstacles.

##### Following are the instructions to run the code:
- Make sure you have the following files in the same directory location:
   1) configurationspace.py
   2) dijkstra_point.py
   3) dijkstra_rigid.py
   4) pathexplorer.py
   5) simplepriorityqueue.py
   6) msgs.txt
- In the terminal where you can run python scripts go to the directory where the above files are located
- Make sure you have numpy installed. *[help](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)*
- For testing point robot:  Type: **$ python dijkstra_point.py**
- For testing rigid robot:  Type: **$ python dijkstra_rigid.py**
- Follow the input instructions that will appear once the scripts are executed.
